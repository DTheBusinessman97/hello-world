Learning how to code for the first time in my life 
Hello everyone my name is Diah, this is a very fun experience for me to start learning how to code in different coding languages I hope that I can manage to get through all these hours of training and start a new hobby or maybe even a career in programming, I always wanted to know how to make my own apps and websites just because it's intresting and fun at the same time.
